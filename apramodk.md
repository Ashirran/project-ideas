## <center> 🦀 The Problem </center>
Calendar apps suck. Life is generally hectic, especially for most people going through major transitions in life such as high school to College or School to work. Calendars apps are supposed to help you manage these things. The problem with existing Calendar or productivity apps such as Notion or Google Calendar is the massive learning curve and the limited functionality. 

## <center> 👁👅👁 The Solution </center>
My project idea, ProdoCal, is a calendar/productivity application, that takes advantage of social networking and machine learning to make scheduling as easy as possible.

In this project social networking will work for many applications, such as establishing meetings like in teams, or automatically adding events from social groups such as a class or company.

The machine learning application will analyze your behavior with certain calendar tasks and adapt scheduling based on your own actions over time. Additionally, for events shared among a social group, your schedualing will be based on a dynamic baseline that changes based on the average of your community. 
For example, if 3 people are in a class and assignment x takes 2 people 20 minutes, the calendar will look for a space of time:
(20 *(average % difference it takes you to complete similar tasks)).

Workflow management and documentation will be handled in Jira and Confluence, while using github for version control.
