# Project Idea: Scheduling Program

## The Problem:

Do you ever find yourself procrastinating through the week and scrambling to finish everything all in a day or two? Do you find yourself getting into a grove just to realize you have something else you have to run off to? Do you have a hard time predicting the best use of your time? Well, then this is the program for you! This program allows users to efficiently plan their week so they know exactly much they need to complete each day in order to finish their tasks in a timely manner. It aims to allow people to create schedules that prevent them from setting up a task just for them to have to tear it down and move on to something else or work for long periods of time without leaving time for breaks. 

## Main Function:

This program plans your week and creates an optimized schedule for you. The user inputs all of the tasks you have to do for the week, an approximation of how long they will take to complete, and a due date/time along with any appointments or prescheduled activities. The program then creates a few options for optimal ways to set up your week. 

## Features:

The user will be able to enter preferences such as:
- times to start and end work
- minimum and maximum lengths of time to work
- lengths of scheduled breaks
- add set up/tear down time to tasks so it can be accounted for in the schedule
- the option to include scheduled time for extra or overflow work

## Users:

The main user base will be people who like to optimize their productivity or people who are looking to find better, more optimal ways to manage their time. 

## Tools:

The program will be written in C++.
