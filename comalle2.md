*Overview*
The proposed project would be a relatively simple idea. It would be a “fantasy” stock trading application. It would essentially operate as a regular stock exchange, but it would utilize a fictional currency to substitute for USD or US dollars. This “fantasy stock exchange” (which will henceforth be abbreviated as simply FSE) will follow the actual stock exchange perfectly. It will display the same prices and values that are the current market conditions. Revenue can be acquired via advertisements, microtransactions, or including supplemental trading strategies and material.

*Major features*
-Real Time Market simulation
-Advertisement functionality for monetization purposes
-1 unit “Fictional Currency” that is equivalent to $1 and functions the same in the simulated market
-A unique website

*Uses, Target Demographic, and What does it Solve?*
This application would solve a very basic and fundamental problem regarding investment and the stock market in general. Where does someone that does not know what they are doing go to figure out how to invest? It provides a safe starting ground for younger and less confident investors giving them a safe spot to test out their strategies before they get involved in the actual stock market. However, the target demographic may not just include younger and less confident investors, it could be effectively marketed to older investors who want to see how returns work, and there is potential for a premium version to be offered to smaller brokerages.

*Tools*
The tools and languages that could be used would likely be Javascript for the website itself while the software aspect may be handled by Python or C++.
