# Summary

My project idea, if i were to pitch one, would be an app or website called VoiceCards. VoiceCards would be a learning app, like quizlet, that uses flash cards as study sets. The primary diffrence between my project VoiceCards and something like quizlet is something that I belive quizlet is missing, voice recoginition. VoiceCard would be able to read aloud flash cards and be able to hear and understand what the user says in response and determine if they have the right answer to the question.

# Problem being solved

The problem with most study apps are that there is not a safe, legal way to use them while stuck in traffic or on the drive to class, which are both great places to study as there is nothing else going on. This use of voice recognition is a perfect solution to this problem.

# some of the major features

- make custom flashcard sets
- read out flashcards and listen for correct responses
- normal flashcard mode

# languages, tool sets, third-party code, etc 

- python
- html/js/css
- git
- possibly flask

# who would use this solution

I feel like this product would be useful for students and trying to memorize information
