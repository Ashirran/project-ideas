# Project Idea: DishList
### Eric Vaughan

### Summary

My project idea is to create a phone application or website that stores user-specific information about restaurants and their dishes. Each user will be able to create reviews of specific dishes at restaurants, and the average of the dish ratings at a given restaurant will then form an overall rating for that restaurant. In addition to the rating within each dish review, users will also be able to add pictures and notes.

### The Problem

When it comes to eating out, one of the biggest problems people face is making a decision about which restaurant they want. Especially if they eat out a lot, people may not remember which restaurants and, more specifically, which dishes they have enjoyed. By having an app dedicated to tracking such information, hopefully the time that people waste trying to figure out where to go can be drastically reduced.

### Target Audience

The target audience for DishList would be anyone that likes to eat out a lot or tries lots of new restaurants frequently. Additionally, people that live in big cities are surrounded by countless restaurants, so DishList can also definitely help them keep track of their favorites.

### Major Features

- A map to search for and find the location of your favorite restaurants
- A restaurant detail page that shows a list of the dishes a user has reviewed at a given restaurant
- A dish detail/review page that shows the rating, pictures, notes of a given dish

### Languages and Tools

- Frontend: React
- Backend: Node.js
- Database: MongoDB
- Restaurants: Yelp-Fusion API
- Map: Leaflet

### Additional Note

This project could be a significant undertaking. If my team and I determine that this is too large of a project for our given time constraints, I would suggest to remove the map feature. Instead, we could just have a list of restaurants on the main page through which users could search.
