## Summary 
An idea I would present would be an app that predicts the winner of sports games. This idea isn't new, but I still enjoy the concept of trying to code it. The primary sport would be college football.

### Problems Solved
With gambling legal in Tennessee, some people love the idea of making a quick buck without putting in any work. This application could aid them in statistically making it more likely that they do not waste their money on the bet they make.

### Features
This application would have to scrape a sports statistics website to get all the information needed to produce its choice for the winner of a game.

It would then of course need to make that prediction. The plan would be to use Machine Learning to predict the winner. I've just started learning about machine learning, so I'm not too sure which exact algorithm yet.

### Languages
I would try to use as much python as I possibly could for this project. Python is one of the more machine learning friendly languages, so it works out. Python has several libraries that are meant for machine learning that will help tremendously. 

### Target Audience
While hopeless gamblers would probably be attracted to this, morally that would be sorta wrong; however, business is business. 

If things went well enough, this could be sold to a sporting business so they could use it to forecat their predictions of the game.
