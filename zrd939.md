# Project Idea

## Summary

My idea for a project idea is to create a photo editing application. I also would like for it to convert images as well.

## Problem

Many photo editing and conversion apps/software is expensive. The free options are typically overun by ads and have limited uses. I want to create a free option that is effective and clean from ads.

## Major Features

- Photo conversion (jpg, png, pdf,  etc.)
- Removing background from photos (png)
- Rotating and inverting photos
- Cropping
- Changing quality of images
- Changing the size of an image

## Languages

I know mainly C++, but I will also be open to Python since I also know some of that language.
For the GUI, I have only ever used PySimpleGUI in the past, but that will not work here. So, I will have to learn a new GUI language. Depending on if it's an app or a website, I might either usee Tkinter or JavaScript.

## Who would buy this?

A lot of people have a need for a photo editor. As a college student, I am always needing to convert imagesto pdfs or into another image file to upload into canvas. A background removing application is useful for people who are needing to put pictures into documents. You don't want to put an image with a blue background onto a white document. This could also be used by the casual user to manipulate images for social media.
