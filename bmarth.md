## Summary

My project idea would be a scheduling program for companies or groups that need to schedule their employees effectively.
For example, in tutoring, the tutors have certain days to help out, and students can only make time to be tutored on certain days.
A tutor can have four days they have available, but they are only willing to tutor on two of them. 
So the question is, how do you most effectively schedule this tutor to overlap with the most students possible without scheduling an
excess of tutors or having a day without any tutors? This program will let the user enter all the tutors' free schedules and how many days to work.
Then enter either the number of students who have signed up to attend on each day or an approximation of how many students on each day.
Then the program will generate the most efficient schedule for your tutors.

## What Problem Is Being Solved

The problem is creating the most efficient schedule for a large group of customers with your smaller group of employees.
The project is mostly focusing on the theme of the most efficient tutor distribution but could be used for other things that fit this problem.
