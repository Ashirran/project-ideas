# Project Idea
## Summary
*Goal*

The Goal of this porject is to create an inventory system for businesses to use that will maintain their inventory, assist in restocking inventory, and give useful metrics for the owners use. A good thing about the way we will build this is that it has a core functionality that will be fairly simple to implement, and an almost unending potential for features that can assist in running a business.

*The* *Problem*

The problem that is being solved here is how difficult it can be to maintain a businesses inventory. Too many businesses (especially small businesses) struggle to keep the right amount of every item stocked so they don't run out but also don't overstock an item and waste it.

*Features*

1. Inventory Management   : The program will keep a database of currently stocked items.
2. Restocking Suggestions : The program will help maintain necessary stock with the assistance of sales forcasting.
3. Sales Tracking         : The program will track sales and use the tracking to forcast future sales.
4. Sales Forecasting      : The program will use past sales compared with recent sales to forcast future sales.
5. Stock Sale Suggestion  : A feature we would like to add if we are able is a way to suggrest a discount sale based on recent sales compared to older sales metrics.

## Languages and Tools

We will be using C++ for the majority of the code involed in the project. We will likely use QT for our graphical user interface due to its portability. There is a chance we will use a web-based database, but we will start with file I/O for storing data.

## Target Customers

Our target customers are business owners.  Most large corporations already have tools like this, but that does not mean they won't want a better tool if it is offered at a better price. Small business owners will also be a large target group as this program would help any who do not have a lot of experience or business training.
