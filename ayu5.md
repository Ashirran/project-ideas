# Sheet Music Generator
## Alex Yu (ayu5)
## Summary
An intuitive, easy-to-use sheet music creator that even the most tech-challenged people can use. Many modern applications are too complicated for some musicians, whether it'd be the UI or the features. Not only would this app introduce a simpler option, it would also include customization for more avant-garde composition.
## Features
- Create and save sheet music
- A simple interface that uses buttons and/or drag-and-drop
- All of the tools a composer needs, like notes, rests, accidentals, signatures and more
- Advanced customization, such as increasing the number of flags a note has (128th notes anyone?), adding more notes per beat (triplets, quintuplets), or custom text for tempo
## Possible Features
- Keybindings for quicker composition
- Downloading other people's compositions and uploading your own
## Toolkit
* C/C++
* Java
## Targeted Audience
Musicians of all kinds, from teachers to composers, as well as younger musicians who want to create their own music.
