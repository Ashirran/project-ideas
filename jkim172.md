## Brief summary of the project idea
My project idea is to help people find the most delicious food using the food ingredients they have. I would like to have an application that manages numerous recipes and recommends them to users. Users can receive the ideal recipe from among the recipes registered by other users by inputting their own ingredients into the server. Recommended recipes will take the user's preference and like/dislike ratio into consideration first. Calorie and nutritional balance can be displayed. If you cannot consume certain ingredients for health or religious reasons, you can set and may be recommended for search results that exclude them.

## What problem is being solved
If you often cook at home, there are times when you get sick of the food you usually eat. With this application, users can find new recipes. Also, users can easily find recipes that meet their tastes and health status.
