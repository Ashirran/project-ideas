**Summary:** My project idea is a **recipe organizer app**. I think this could be a phone
app or a desktop app. The user would put their own recipe or copy and paste a recipe from
elsewhere and put it in a file. The user may put notes and pictures as well. The application 
will allow the user to easily organize and find their recipes.

## The Problem

This is actually a personal problem I have. I have a habit of just screen shotting any
recipe that I might want to try in the near, or distant, future. This then junks up my
screenshots folder, and it is very hard to find the recipe. I wish I could just type
some keywords, and have the intended recipe appear in seconds. 

### Major Features

- Find recipes by typing in keywords, like an advanced version of control f.
- The app will start listing recipes that contain your keywords and narrow down as you type more.
- Can change listing settings to show corresponding pictures with the listings.

### Possible Features

- Stores what you have in your fridge and pantry
- Recommends recipes based on this
- Creates a grocery list based on this and your chosen recipes

#### Possible Languages and Tools

- The backend storing everything could be created with c++.
- The user interface could be created with a GUI framework for Python.

#### Possible Users/Customers

- Anyone who cooks a lot or wants to get into cooking
- People who don't want to organize recipes by hand
- People who like cute organizer apps
