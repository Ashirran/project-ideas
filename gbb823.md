# Simple Port and Vulnerability Scanner (SPVS)
<hr/>

## What is SPVS?
Simple Port and Vulnerability Scanner (SPVS) would serve as an easy-to-use, no-setup networked scanner. SPVS would be able to take individual target information from the user (either by manual entry or via a file), scan those targets based on given user specifications, and return concise results. The scanner would be able to determine the status of the system, fingerprint it's operating system, determine open/closed ports, and known vulnerabilites on the system.

## What problem does SPVS solve?
While there are many port and vulnerability scanners in use today, SPVS seeks to be the simplest and easy to use in a hurry. SPVS seeks to be a screwdriver, rather than a fully equipped drill to provide ultimate simplicity and ease of use. While the tool is not intended for scanning wide ranges of corporate networks, checking an individual system or a subnet of systems is where this tool thrives due to its minimalist approach.

## Major features:
* Full range port scanning for target or lists of targets. 
* Port insights to aide in reconnaissance efforts.
* Operating System fingerprinting to determine what OS is in use on a particular machine.
* Vulnerability scanner to find commonly expolited vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
* Easy-to-read scanning results.
* Web-interface for internet scanning.

## Languagues and Toolsets
Because of the primitive nature of port scanning and command line tools, C/C++ would be the best option for the backend. For a web-app addition, Javascript framework React would be the easiest to learn and deploy for such a simple interface.

In addition to programming the application, an adequate understanding of networking would be required. Because of the legal implications of scanning target machines, vulnerable lab machines would need to be deployed. For this, a virtual machine manager like Oracle's Virtualbox or VMware could be used.

## Who would use SPVS?
Because of the intended simplicity of SPVS, the goal of the software is that anyone could use it. More practically speaking however, SPVS is target at the InfoSec community as a grab-and-go tool for scanning targets. The software is intended to be free and opensource as well in order to better cater to its intended audience.
