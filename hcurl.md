# Project Proposal - Hayden Curl

## Overview
My Semester Project idea is an application to track the the daily health of multiple users. Each user first plugs in general information about their body such as sex, height, weight, age, and level of physical activity. Based off of the user input, the application would generate a GUI containing a spreadsheet of weekly numbers to meet for a healthy diet. The user would also be given the opportunity to describe their health goals (lose weight, maintain weight, gain weight) and recommend a workout plan to go with their diet to help the user reach their health goals. There would also be a place for the user to enter their daily progress, such as the completion of a workout or what they consumed throughout the day.

## Problem Solved
Many people get discouraged because of the time it takes to reach certain health goals. To combat this, the application would break down the user's goal into small, reachable increments, helping keep the user on track.

## Major Features
* Diet plan generated off of user input
* Exercise plan generated off of user input
* A friendly GUI to view goals, daily progress, and completed goals

## Languages
* C/C# for backend
* Python/QT for user interface

## Who Would Buy This?
I think that anyone who cares about their health would receive benefit from this application due to the ability to organize and break down goals into reachable "checkpoints". Whether the user is overweight and looking to lose weight or a D1 athlete, this app would be designed to help any user accomplish their health goals.
