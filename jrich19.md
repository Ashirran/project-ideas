# Project Idea

## Summary of Project and Features
My project idea is to collaborate with the University of Tennessee Outdoor Pursuits (UTOP) to create a web application to make 
trip planning easier and more efficient. This application should be able to be viewed on a desktop or an Ipad.
### Possible features include: 
- create and edit multiple trips at once
- generate gear packing lists with checkboxes based on trip type, length, and number of participants
- generate meal plans for trips based on dietary restrictions, number of participants, length of trip, and added recipies
- generate grocery list based on meal plan
- create and edit recipies/meal ideas 
- takes the grocery list and interfaces with Walmart online grocery to order all of the ingredients
- can leave comments after a trip of how much food was left over or if there wasn't enough food 
so that future trips, the application is suggest adjustments to the meal plan

## What problems does this project solve?
Currently, the outdoor center is using manual methods of planning trips by using excel spread sheets. I talked to the head coordinator and
essentially he just estimates how much food he would eat and multiply the quantity of food by the number of participants. This is a very time
consuming and tedious process as well as there has been times where they have had too much food or barely enough. This project will help
make trip planning easier as well as reduce food waste.

## What technology would this project use?
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Node.js
- Database: SQLite3
- Server: Microsoft Azure

## Who would use this project?
UTOP would use this project to help plan their outdoor trips and then anyone who is looking for 
a trip planner can use this project as well.
