# Summary
### Have you ever been in a foreign city, state, or country and struggle with knowing where to go or what to do? Or have you ever wanted a platform so that you can organize your own travel experiences so that you can view them in the future? Well, this project will entail creating an app that allows users to document their travel experiences for others to see and interact with. The app will include a map of the world, where users can click on a country to see the experiences of other users. This will not only help tourists but also locals who are trying to explore their own city.  

# Problem being solved
### The problem being solved is that tourists and locals often struggle to find locations to explore with friends, family, or even alone. Therefore, this app will allow for users to share their own experiences through pictures and text for others to judge and determine if they would like it as well. Likewise, the user will be able to document their own experiences so that they can look back on them in the future.

# Features
### The app will allow users to create a profile, upload photos/videos, and write about their experiences. The app will also allow users to search for other users and see their profiles/experiences, and also document their own experiences from the past.

# Tools/Languages
1. C/C++
1. Python
1. Git

# Who would use this app?
### This app would be used by tourists and locals who are looking to explore their city or a new city. Also, this app would be used by people who are looking to share their experiences with others and those who are looking to organize their own experiences into a single app.
