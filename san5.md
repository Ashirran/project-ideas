## Brief Summary of the Project Idea
My project idea is to create an application or website that has information about Vol Dining. I am thinking that if we have an application that has a map of the campus with icons at each location of the places that can eat. When users click each icon, they can see the address of the location, standard hours, menu, and cost. Users also can see it as a list. If the user has one of the unlimited plans that can use meal equivalency (the app asks about the usersâ€™ meal plan when they first installed it), it also shows whether the meal equivalency is available in that place at that particular time, and if so, shows the costs that the meal equivalency is applied. There is a filter for vegetarians which only shows the locations that have vegetarian options.

## Problem Being Solved
There is a Vol Dining website, but it is hard to see which restaurants are open at what time and whether or not students who have unlimited meal plans can use their meal equivalencies or not. 

## List of Major Features
- Campus map with icons at each location
- Icons with color when the location is open during the time that the user uses the app
  - Grey if it is not opened
- Information about each location 
- Meal equivalency costs
- Meal Equivalency available locations during the time of user using the app
- Filter for vegetarians
- (If available) recommendations of locations based on their location using GPS
